  <h3>About</h3>
  <p><%= link_to 'News Shaman', '/' %> aims to highlight the emotional impact and rhythmic flow of reading a collection of news stories. Its first version is an editorial tool that offers a quick view of the emotional analytics of a given story or list of stories. This allows a publisher to gauge whether their feature series or newsletter digest is setting an emotional tone that fits their readers, and begin to iterate on the best flow for their content; is it better to open with a downer and finish with an inspiring glimmer of hope, or start irreverent and end with a sober reflection? Combined with analytics tools, News Shaman can begin to answer these questions, and help gain editorial insight into how readers are reading and reacting to stories.</p>
  <p>This project was built by Liam Andrew, Kathryn Beaty, and Ben Hasson at The Huffington Post and Change.org Editors Lab hackathon in NYC on April 8-9, 2016. Code is available on <%= link_to 'GitHub', 'https://www.github.com/texastribune/shaman/' %>.</p>
